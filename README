thekogans_make represents the second half of 'thekogans.net development
environment and build system'. the build system uses the conventions
prescribed by thekogans_toolchain to automate many basic build tasks.

thekogans_make is extensively customizable using plugins. to do that,
your plugin must derive from thekogans::util::Plugins::Plugin::Interface
and link against thekogans_make_core. to automate that, use the
$TOOLCHAIN_ROOT/common/bin/makeplugin script. the resulting boilerplate
project will have appropriate stubs for you to overwrite.
